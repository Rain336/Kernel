//! # Parsing of escape sequences for Terminal Output.
//!
//! The parsing is done though a state machine enum [`EscapeMode`].
//! On start, the state machine is [`EscapeMode::None`] state.
//! When a `` char is encountered, the state changes to [`EscapeMode::ExpectOpenBrace`] and following characters aren't printed.
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::ExpectOpenBrace`] state, a `[` needs to follow, or the state is returned to [`EscapeMode::None`] and the invalid char printed.
//! If a `[` was supplied, the state changes to [`EscapeMode::StartSequence`].
//!
//! From [`EscapeMode::StartSequence`], the state machine branches into:
//! - If the incoming char is `3`, go into [`EscapeMode::ForegroundColor`] state.
//! - If the incoming char is `4`, go into [`EscapeMode::BackgroundColor`] state.
//! - If the incoming char is `9`, go into [`EscapeMode::ForegroundBrightColor`] state.
//! - If the incoming char is `1`, go into [`EscapeMode::ExpectZero`] state.
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::ForegroundColor`], the next char is passed to [`theme::get_color`] to set the foreground color and
//! sate is changed to [`EscapeMode::FinishSequence`].
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::BackgroundColor`], the next char is passed to [`theme::get_color`] to set the background color and
//! sate is changed to [`EscapeMode::FinishSequence`].
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::ForegroundBrightColor`], the next char is passed to [`theme::get_bright_color`] to set the foreground color and
//! sate is changed to [`EscapeMode::FinishSequence`].
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::ExpectZero`], the next char has to be `0` or state is changed back to [`EscapeMode::None`].
//! If a `0` was encountered, state is changed to [`EscapeMode::BackgroundBrightColor`].
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::BackgroundBrightColor`], the next char is passed to [`theme::get_bright_color`] to set the background color and
//! sate is changed to [`EscapeMode::FinishSequence`].
//!
//! In [`EscapeMode::FinishSequence`], if an `m` is encountered, the state is changed into [`EscapeMode::None`].
//! If a `;` is encountered, state is changed to [`EscapeMode::StartSequence`].
